# money-management
A terminal based money managemnt application to manage your wallet.


# Usage
I still haven't decided on what features i will be adding to it. But things
that are going to be added are,

- create a wallet
- add a balance to a wallet
- add a purchase ( it will deduct the money from the wallet balance)

these are the ones added for now.

# What's there for it in the future?
I want to add the feature to create a loan in it. Like when you take a loan from someone
you can add it to the app as a loan.
